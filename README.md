Make sure that node.js is installed first. In the terminal, run "npm install" to install dependencies - in this case, inquirer.

<h3 id='usage'>Usage</h3>
In the terminal, enter "node index.js" to run the program.

<h3 id='contributions'>Contributions</h3>
Contact the author through GitHub or email with suggestions and comments.

<h3 id='license'>License</h3>

<h3 id='test'>Tests</h3>

<h3 id='questions'>Issues and Questions</h3>
