<br><h3 id='description'>Description</h3>
A short program that quickly generates a readme based upon user input and a pre-defined template.

<h3 id='installation'>Installation</h3>
Make sure that node.js is installed first. In the terminal, run "npm install" to install dependencies - in this case, inquirer.

<h3 id='usage'>Usage</h3>
In the terminal, enter "node index.js" to run the program.

<h3 id='contributions'>Contributions</h3>
Contact the author through GitHub or email with suggestions and comments.

<h3 id='license'>License</h3>
This project is licensed under the MIT License.

<h3 id='test'>Tests</h3>
After running the program, there is an option to create a test readme named "dev-test-readme.md", rather than "README.md". This can be useful if you don't want to overwrite your current README.md file.

<h3 id='questions'>Issues and Questions</h3>
Issues and questions can be emailed to 'kmillergit' at the domain 'outlook.com'. The author's GitHub profile may be found at https://github.com/Koldenblue.
